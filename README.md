# opencode-talk

**Voice + remote control for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai): talk to the agent
and let it talk back, and drive the same sessions from Telegram or any Nostr
client — including a Telegram group where every session gets its own topic.**

**Voice**

- **Speech-to-text (STT)** — press `<leader>v` (or run `/mic`), speak, and the
  transcript becomes a prompt. Local `faster-whisper` by default (offline,
  private, no API key), or any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions`
  endpoint; PipeWire, PulseAudio, ALSA, `sox` and `ffmpeg` (AVFoundation on
  macOS, DirectShow on Windows) are auto-detected.
- **Text-to-speech (TTS)** — the main agent's replies are **spoken aloud** with
  neural voices (edge-tts), automatic **pt / en / fr** language detection and a
  robotic `spd-say` fallback. Runs in the server plugin, so every client gets
  it; reasoning is opt-in.
- **Editable send + polish** — by default `/mic send` opens an editable dialog
  so you can fix the transcript before it is sent, and the optional `polish`
  step runs it through the model you are already using.
- **Voice in Telegram** — incoming voice notes and audio files are transcribed
  and attached to the prompt, so OpenCode receives the audio itself even when
  transcription fails; `/talk` sends agent replies back as spoken audio
  messages.
- Commands: `/mic` (`start|send|abort|off|status|help`), `/mic-setup`
  (settings menu), `/sound` (`on|off|pause|status|help`), `/talk` — `/talk
  help` lists every command this plugin adds.

**Remote control**

- **Telegram** — in-process bot: project/session menus (`/menu`, `/projects`,
  `/project`, `/sessions`, `/new`, `/use`), model + reasoning switching
  (`/models`, `/model <number|provider/model> [effort]`), `/status`, `/abort`,
  `/nostr`, plain-text prompts, in-place progress edits, agent photos and
  voice replies. Editing a submitted message stops the current run and
  re-prompts with the new text. `/telegram <bot-token> <group-id>` registers
  the **"Opencode Talk" group**, where every session gets its own forum topic
  seeded with the session's project + model/reasoning; creating a topic there
  creates a new session, and session renames rename the topic. `/projects`
  lists every OpenCode project (TUI/desktop picker) plus `TELEGRAM_PROJECTS`,
  `/telegram <chat-id>` links extra private chats, and
  `/telegram stop|start|talk|shut` controls the bot.
- **XMPP** — same features as Telegram over XMPP: `/menu`, `/projects`,
  `/project`, `/sessions`, `/new`, `/use`, `/models`, `/model <number|provider/model> [effort]`,
  `/status`, `/abort`, `/nostr`, plain-text prompts, progress + voice replies.
  `/xmpp <jid> <password> [muc-room]` connects the bot and registers the MUC
  room (one thread per session, seeded with project + model/reasoning);
  `/xmpp <token>` saves just the password when the JID comes from `XMPP_JID`.
  `/xmpp <contact-jid>` links extra direct chats, `/xmpp room <muc-room>`
  registers the room, and `/xmpp stop|start|talk|shut` controls the bot.
  Setup: [docs/XMPP_SETUP.md](docs/XMPP_SETUP.md).
- **Nostr** — every session owns its own keypair (npub). Pair with
  `/nostr <your-npub>`: the session DMs a welcome with the model + reasoning
  already selected. Encrypted NIP-04 DMs then drive the session with the same
  commands, scope projects, switch model/reasoning, abort, and receive agent
  images (Blossom). `/nostr off|on` halts/resumes relay traffic.
- **Any other `/command`** — forwarded to OpenCode as-is, so custom commands
  and skills work remotely too.
- **Agent tool** — `telegram_send_image` lets the agent push screenshots,
  charts and renders to your Telegram/Nostr chat.
- **Session API + remote plugin** — REST + SSE for any client, typed RPC and
  compact progress events, single-flight loops and a shared poll lock that
  keeps exactly one Telegram poller even with several OpenCode servers. See
  [Remote control](#remote-control-telegram--nostr) below.

> OpenCode's plugin API can't write into the prompt composer, so the transcript
> is delivered with `session.prompt` (after an editable dialog). Toasts and the
> `/mic-setup` settings menu are **terminal-TUI** features; the web/desktop
> clients only run the server commands.

## How it works

```
/mic  ──▶ recorder (temp WAV) ──▶ speech-to-text ──▶ (edit) ──▶ session.prompt
agent reply ──▶ text-to-speech (edge-tts) ──▶ speakers
```

1. `src/recorder.ts` spawns the first available capture tool and writes a mono
   16 kHz WAV to a temp directory.
2. `src/transcribe.ts` runs the configured backend (local `faster-whisper` by
   default, or an OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint).
3. `src/tui.ts` / `index.ts` deliver the text to the active session (optionally
   edited in a dialog and optionally cleaned up by the current model first).
4. `src/speech.ts` speaks the main agent's replies with `edge-tts`
   (auto-detecting pt/en/fr) or `spd-say`, with a single, deduplicated queue.

Service/CLI plugins are two halves of one package: `index.ts` (server — the
`/mic` and `/sound` commands, plus TTS playback) and `tui.ts` (the terminal UI —
keybind, toasts, editable send and the settings menu).

## Requirements

- OpenCode v2 (`opencode --version` → `2.x`).
- A microphone and one capture tool: `pw-record` (PipeWire), `parecord`
  (PulseAudio), `arecord` (ALSA), `sox`, or `ffmpeg`.
- For local STT: `faster-whisper` in the bundled `.venv` (set up by
  `npm install`) or any Whisper CLI.
- For cloud STT: an API key for your provider.

## Install

This is **already installed** in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`, which is
what makes it appear in OpenCode's plugin/extension list:

```jsonc title="~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["/home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice"]
}
```

Run `npm install` once in this directory: its `postinstall` hook creates the
bundled `.venv` and installs the Python engines (`edge-tts` for speech,
`faster-whisper` for transcription). Re-run it any time with `npm run setup`
(or `OPENCODE_VOICE_SKIP_SETUP=1 npm install` to skip the Python step, e.g. in
CI).

The plugin is **self-configuring**: at load it looks for
`.venv/bin/python` and `scripts/whisper_transcribe.py` next to itself, and uses
the bundled local engine when they exist. No options are required.

> **Why not `options`?** When a plugin is registered in `opencode.json`, OpenCode
> currently does not forward its `options` object to the TUI half (`context.options`
> arrives empty). Configure it through environment variables instead, or use the
> CLI-only `cli.json` form below if you want `options`.

### Environment overrides

Set these before launching `opencode`:

| Variable                          | Purpose                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_BACKEND`          | `local` or `api`. Overrides auto-detection.                          |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_LOCAL_COMMAND`    | Shell command for the local backend. Supports `{audio}`.             |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_BASE_URL`         | OpenAI-compatible base URL (cloud backend).                          |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_MODEL`            | Cloud transcription model.                                           |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_API_KEY`          | Cloud bearer token. Also read from `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GROQ_API_KEY`.  |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_LANGUAGE`         | ISO-639-1 hint, e.g. `en`.                                           |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_MODEL`    | faster-whisper model: `base` (default), `tiny.en`, `small`, …        |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_LANGUAGE` | Language for the local wrapper (default: auto-detect).              |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_COMPUTE`  | `int8` (default), `int8_float16`, `float16`, `float32`.              |

<details>
<summary>CLI-only install (honours <code>options</code>, but not listed)</summary>

Plugins declared in `cli.json` keep their `options` and stay active even against
a remote server, but they do **not** show in the plugin/extension list:

```json title="~/.config/opencode/cli.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/v2/cli.json",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "/home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice",
      "options": {
        "backend": "local",
        "localCommand": "/home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice/.venv/bin/python /home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice/scripts/whisper_transcribe.py {audio}",
        "keybind": "<leader>v",
        "slash": "voice"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Alternative: discovery via a plugins directory</summary>

OpenCode also discovers plugins under the global config directory and project
`.opencode` directories, so you can symlink this project instead of editing
`opencode.jsonc`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
ln -sfn /home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice ~/.config/opencode/plugins/mic
```

The `tui.ts` and `index.ts` files at the project root are the entry points used
by that layout.

</details>

Restart the terminal app (or run `opencode service restart`) so the plugin is
picked up.

### Changing the keybind

Override the command binding in `cli.json`:

```json title="~/.config/opencode/cli.json"
{
  "keybinds": { "voice.input.toggle": "ctrl+shift+v" }
}
```

## Usage

1. Open a session.
2. Start recording — press `<leader>v` (by default `Ctrl+X` then `v`), or run
   `/mic` (`/mic start` also works).
3. A "Recording…" toast appears. Speak.
4. Stop & transcribe — press the key again, run `/mic` (it toggles), or
   `/mic send`. By default this opens an **editable dialog** with the
   transcript so you can fix it before sending (press Enter to send, Esc to
   discard). Set `OPENCODE_VOICE_SUBMIT=send` to send directly instead.
5. To **cancel** (discard, send nothing), run `/mic abort` (`cancel`, `abort`,
   `parar` also work).
6. Run `/mic help` (or `/sound help`) any time to see the command reference,
   `/mic status` (or `/sound status`) for current state.

Recording also stops automatically after `maxDuration` seconds (default 120).

### Configuration menu

Run `/mic-setup` (or pick **Voice: configuração** from `Ctrl+P`) to:

- switch between **local** transcription (no key needed) and the **cloud API**;
- set the API key, `baseURL` and model — stored at
  `~/.config/opencode/voice.json` (mode `0600`, **outside this repository**, so
  it is never committed);
- choose the Portuguese, English and French TTS voices and toggle language
  auto-detection;
- enable/disable speech, and choose whether the agent's reasoning ("thinking")
  is spoken too;
- review the current settings (the key is shown masked).

Changes apply immediately — the plugin re-reads `voice.json` on every use.

## Text-to-speech (agent messages)

The plugin also reads the **main agent's** messages aloud:

- **Only the main agent** — messages from subagent/child sessions are never spoken.
- **Only assistant prose** — tool calls and shell/command output are not spoken. Code blocks, inline code, URLs and Markdown markup are stripped first so it reads like speech.
- **Reasoning is opt-in** — the agent's grey "thinking" text is skipped unless you enable it with `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_REASONING=1` (or the settings menu). Off by default.
- Runs in the **server** plugin, so it works in every client (TUI, desktop, web).
- Utterances are queued and serialized machine-wide, so agent messages and reasoning parts play one after another instead of talking over each other.

The default engine is **edge-tts** — Microsoft's neural voices, which sound
natural and include European Portuguese (`pt-PT-RaquelNeural`) and English
(`en-US-AriaNeural`). It is wired in through the bundled wrapper
`scripts/edge_tts_play.py`; if synthesis or playback ever fails it falls back to
`spd-say`.

**Language auto-detection:** each message is classified as Portuguese, English or
French and the matching voice is used, so replies are read with the right voice.
Set `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_AUTO=0` to disable it (then everything uses
`OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE`).

Because edge-tts uses an online service, it needs internet at speak time. For a
completely offline voice, use Piper (below), or force the robotic fallback with
`OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_ENGINE=spd-say`.

Configure with environment variables (set them before launching `opencode`, then
`opencode service restart`):

| Variable                       | Default                | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS`           | `1`                    | Set to `0` to disable speech.                                      |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_ENGINE`    | auto (`command`)       | `command` (bundled edge-tts), `spd-say`, or your own command.      |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_AUTO`      | `1`                    | Auto-detect Portuguese/English and pick the matching voice.        |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_REASONING` | `0`                    | Set to `1` to also speak the agent's reasoning ("thinking") text.  |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE`     | `pt`                   | Portuguese voice: `pt`, `pt-br`, or a full edge voice name.        |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE_EN`  | `en-US-AriaNeural`     | Voice used for English messages.                                   |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE_FR`  | `fr-FR-DeniseNeural`   | Voice used for French messages.                                    |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_RATE`      | `0`                    | `-100`..`100` (positive is faster).                                |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_MAX`       | `1500`                 | Max characters spoken per message (`0` = no limit).                |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_COMMAND`   | bundled edge wrapper   | Command for `engine=command`; the text is written to its stdin.    |
| `OPENCODE_VOICE_EDGE_VOICE`    | –                      | Explicit edge voice, overrides the language-based choice.          |

Voice mapping: `pt` → `pt-PT-RaquelNeural`, `pt-br` → `pt-BR-FranciscaNeural`,
`en` → `en-US-AriaNeural`, `en-gb` → `en-GB-SoniaNeural`,
`fr` → `fr-FR-DeniseNeural`, `es` → `es-ES-ElviraNeural`, and so on. Examples:

```sh
OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE=pt-PT-DuarteNeural      # male European Portuguese
OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_VOICE_EN=en-GB-SoniaNeural    # British English
```

### Sound commands

- `/sound` — toggle speech on/off. When turning it on it says “Voz ligada.”
- `/sound on` (`start`, `ligar`) — enable speech.
- `/sound off` (`stop`, `desligar`) — disable speech **and** stop speaking
  immediately (cuts the current utterance and clears the queue).
- `/sound pause` (`silence`, `calar`, `parar`) — silence now, but keep speech on.
- `/sound status` — show switch, engine, voices and limits.
- `/sound help` (`ajuda`) — show the command usage.

Starting a recording (`/mic`, `/mic start`) automatically silences the current
utterance so the microphone doesn't pick it up.

Works from any client, and persists to `~/.config/opencode/voice.json`.

### Fully offline (Piper, optional)

[Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) is a small neural TTS that runs
offline — less natural than edge-tts, but far better than espeak-ng. Install it
and a Portuguese voice, then point `OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_COMMAND` at it (Piper
reads the text on stdin and writes WAV to stdout):

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pip install piper-tts
# download a voice, e.g. pt_PT-tugão-medium.onnx (+ .json) into ~/mics
export OPENCODE_VOICE_TTS_COMMAND="$PWD/.venv/bin/piper -m $HOME/mics/pt_PT-tugao-medium.onnx -f - | paplay"
opencode service restart
```

Any command that consumes text on stdin and plays audio works (e.g. `espeak`,
`piper`, a cloud TTS CLI).

## Options

These are read from the plugin `options` object when the plugin is loaded via
`cli.json`. With the `opencode.json` install they are ignored — use the
environment variables above instead.

## Examples

### Local faster-whisper (default here)

The bundled wrapper is used automatically. `npm install` (postinstall) or
`npm run setup` creates the environment with both engines:

```sh
npm install                               # dev deps + .venv (edge-tts, faster-whisper)
npm run setup                             # run just the Python setup again
OPENCODE_VOICE_SKIP_SETUP=1 npm install   # skip the Python step (CI)
```

The model is downloaded on first use and cached by Hugging Face. Tune it with
environment variables:

```sh
export OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_MODEL=base.en   # tiny.en is faster, small is more accurate
export OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en     # skip auto-detect
```

Point `localCommand`/`OPENCODE_VOICE_LOCAL_COMMAND` at any other Whisper CLI if
you prefer. For `openai-whisper`:

```
whisper {audio} --model small --language en --output_format txt --output_dir {outdir}
```

For `whisper.cpp`:

```
whisper-cli -m /path/to/ggml-base.en.bin -f {audio} -otxt -of {out}
```

### Cloud STT (Groq, very fast)

```sh
export OPENCODE_VOICE_BACKEND=api
export OPENCODE_VOICE_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
export OPENCODE_VOICE_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo
export OPENAI_API_KEY=   # not used
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```

```sh
export OPENCODE_VOICE_BACKEND=api
export OPENCODE_VOICE_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
export OPENCODE_VOICE_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

### Preview before sending, and polish the text

With the `cli.json` install:

```json
{
  "package": "/home/hdlrocha/opencode-voice",
  "options": { "confirm": true, "polish": true, "language": "en" }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **The plugin is not in the plugins list** — it must be registered in
  `opencode.json(c)` (not `cli.json`) and the server must be restarted. Verify
  with `opencode plugin list` and `opencode api get /api/plugin`.
- **"no microphone recorder available"** — install one of `pipewire`
  (`pw-record`), `pulseaudio-utils` (`parecord`), `alsa-utils` (`arecord`),
  `sox`, or `ffmpeg`. On macOS/Windows you need `ffmpeg`.
- **"recording produced no audio"** — the recorder started but captured
  nothing. Check your input device and, on macOS, that
  `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i :0` lists a real audio device index.
- **"transcription failed" / empty text** — try a larger model
  (`OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_MODEL=small`) or set
  `OPENCODE_VOICE_WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en`.
- **"no API key"** — the cloud backend was selected but no key is available;
  set `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GROQ_API_KEY`, or unset `OPENCODE_VOICE_BACKEND` to use
  the bundled local engine.
- **Nothing happens on `<leader>v`** — the leader key may be rebound. Check
  `keybinds.leader`, or bind the command directly with
  `keybinds["voice.input.toggle"]`.

## Development

```sh
npm install        # dev deps + the bundled Python engines (.venv)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit (voice + remote)
npm test           # typecheck + voice smoke test + remote vitest suites
npm run build      # compile the remote runtime (Session API + bots) to dist/
```

OpenCode resolves `@opencode/plugin/tui` at runtime, so the plugin runs without
a build step. The import is only needed locally for TypeScript.

## Remote control (Telegram + Nostr)

The same sessions, from your phone or any Nostr client — through an
independent **Session API** (REST + SSE) and a small OpenCode plugin. Voice
and remote are independent halves: use either or both.

```
Telegram → Telegram Adapter →┐
                             ├→ Session API → Remote Plugin → OpenCode Session
Nostr    → Nostr Adapter   →┘
```

- **Telegram** (`src/remote/telegram/`): grammY standalone bot + in-process
  plugin bot (`pluginBot.ts`, raw Bot API polling). `/sessions`, `/new`,
  `/use <n|id>`, `/status`, `/abort`, `/nostr [npub]`; plain text prompts the
  selected session; progress edits one `🤖 …` message; agent screenshots
  arrive as photos. From OpenCode, `/telegram <bot-token> <group-id>`
  registers an **"Opencode Talk" group and `/telegram` gives every session its
  own forum topic** (project + model/reasoning seeded from the session).
  `/telegram <chat-id>` still links an extra private chat.
  Setup: [docs/TELEGRAM_SETUP.md](docs/TELEGRAM_SETUP.md).
- **Nostr** (`src/remote/nostr/`): encrypted DMs, two modes. Plugin-native
  (recommended): the remote plugin itself connects to relays — each session
  owns a keypair, DM its npub directly, pair with OpenCode `/nostr <your-npub>`.
  Standalone: encrypted-DM client of the Session API, paired via Telegram
  `/nostr <your-npub>`. Setup: [docs/NOSTR_SETUP.md](docs/NOSTR_SETUP.md).
- **Session API** (`src/remote/session-api/` + `src/remote/opencode/`): Express
  server over `@opencode/client` — session CRUD, `POST …/message`, `…/abort`,
  media store for agent images, SSE fan-out. Reference: [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).
- **Remote plugin** (`remote-plugin/`, id `telegram-bridge`): typed RPC
  (`sendMessage`/`abort`/`status`), compact progress events, a
  `telegram_send_image` agent tool ("run the app 2 minutes and send me the
  screenshot"), and the in-process Nostr bridge (`/nostr`). Install:
  [docs/PLUGIN_INSTALL.md](docs/PLUGIN_INSTALL.md).

Quick start (plugin-native Telegram + Nostr — no API/bot processes):

```sh
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...
export TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
export NOSTR_RELAYS=wss://nos.lol,wss://relay.snort.social
export NOSTR_ALLOWED_NPUBS=npub1you...
opencode service restart
# Telegram: message the bot, /sessions, /use 1 — or link from OpenCode: /telegram <chat-id>
# Bot + group: /telegram <bot-token> <group-id>, or /telegram group <group-id> after /telegram <bot-token>
# Voice to Telegram: /telegram talk (off with /telegram shut); halt bot: /telegram stop
# Every plugin command: /talk help
# Nostr: inside OpenCode: /nostr, then /nostr <your-npub>, then DM the session npub
```

### Telegram group: one topic per OpenCode session (recommended)

Use a single Telegram group as a session hub instead of private chats.
One-time setup:

#### 1. Create the bot with @BotFather

1. Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and send `/newbot`.
2. Pick a display name (e.g. `OpenCode Talk`) and a username ending in `bot`
   (e.g. `opencode_talk_bot`).
3. Copy the token BotFather replies with (`123456:ABC-DEF...`) — treat it like
   a password. The plugin saves it to `TELEGRAM_TOKEN_FILE` (mode 0600).
4. Optional but recommended:
   - `/setjoingroups` → **Enable** (default) so the bot can be added to the
     group.
   - `/setprivacy` → select the bot → **Disable**. An admin bot receives all
     group messages anyway (see step 3), but disabling privacy keeps
     plain-text prompts working if the bot is ever demoted.

#### 2. Create the group

1. Telegram → **New Group** → name it **Opencode Talk** → add the bot as a
   member (search its @username).
2. Open the group → **Edit** → enable **Topics** (forum mode). Without Topics
   the bot cannot create the per-session topics.
3. Find the group id (negative, e.g. `-1001234567890`):
   - add [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to the group — it posts the
     group id (remove it afterwards), or
   - send a message in the group and open
     `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser — look for
     `"chat":{"id":-100…}`. This needs the bot to be an admin or to have
     privacy disabled (steps 1.4/3).

#### 3. Give the bot permissions in the group

1. Group → **Edit** → **Administrators** → **Add Admin** → select the bot.
2. Enable:
   - **Manage Topics** — required: creates the per-session forum topics.
   - **Send Messages** — required (on by default).
   - **Delete Messages** — optional: lets it tidy its own progress messages.
3. Save. As an admin the bot receives every group message, regardless of
   privacy mode.

#### 4. Register the group and use it

1. In OpenCode run `/telegram <bot-token> <group-id>`: the token is verified,
   saved locked-down (`TELEGRAM_TOKEN_FILE`, mode 0600), the bot connects, and
   the group is registered. You can also do it in two steps — connect the bot
   with `/telegram <bot-token>`, then the group with
   `/telegram group <group-id>`.
2. From any session run `/telegram` (or any time later): the bot creates or
   reuses a topic named after the session, binds it, and posts the first
   message showing the session's **project** and **model + reasoning already
   selected**.
3. Write in a topic to prompt that session — progress edits and results stay
   in the topic. `/models`, `/model`, `/status`, `/abort`, `/nostr` work there
   too; `/telegram status` shows state without touching the group.
4. Creating a topic yourself works in reverse: the bot creates a new session
   named after the topic, binds it, and asks for model + reasoning. Telegram
   only delivers topic-creation notices to administrators, so keep the bot an
   admin (step 3).
5. Renaming the session (e.g. in the TUI) renames its bound topic to match.
   A topic renamed by hand stays as typed until the session is renamed again.

Prerequisites: group mode requires the **plugin-native** bot (it creates
topics through the same in-process polling loop); `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`
must contain your user id. The standalone `dev:bot` process ignores topic
mappings.

Telegram allows only **one `getUpdates` consumer per bot token**. If several
OpenCode servers run (e.g. the desktop app's server plus the background
`opencode serve --service`), the first to start polls and the others run in
**secondary mode** — no polling, but topic linking and sends still work from
those processes — instead of fighting with `409 Conflict`.
`TELEGRAM_LOCK_FILE` overrides the shared lock path when the plugin is
installed in more than one place. Stopping one server is still recommended:
each server resolves relative paths (`./data/...`) against its own working
directory, so their mappings/state differ — set absolute paths in `.env`
(or run one server) to keep them in sync.

Quick start (standalone adapters via the Session API):

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # SESSION_API_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ...
npm run dev:api        # Session API on 127.0.0.1:3456
npm run dev:bot        # Telegram bot
npm run dev:nostr      # Nostr adapter (needs NOSTR_RELAYS)
```

Remote config lives in `.env` (see `.env.example`); voice config stays in
`voice.json`. Secrets for both are git-ignored.
